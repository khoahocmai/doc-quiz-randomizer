# doc-quiz-randomizer

A Node.js utility for generating a randomized quiz document from a .docx file containing questions. This tool reads questions and multiple-choice options from a source file (e.g., questions.docx), randomizes the order of both the questions and the answer options, and then outputs a new .docx file with the following characteristics:

- **Randomized Questions:** Each question is re-numbered and its answer options are shuffled (the correct answer is not indicated within the question).
- **Answer Summary:** At the end of the document, a summary section lists the correct answer(s) for each question (displayed in white text).
- **Custom Styling:** All text in the document is rendered in Arial font at 14pt size.

## Features

- Parses a .docx file to extract questions and multiple-choice answers.
- Randomizes the order of questions and answer options.
- Supports filtering questions based on a specified range.
- Generates a new .docx file (randoms.docx) with:
  - Questions and their shuffled answer choices.
  - An answer summary section at the end (answers displayed in white).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- A source .docx file (questions.docx) that contains your quiz questions following the expected format.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khoahocmai/doc-quiz-randomizer.git
   cd doc-quiz-randomizer
   ```

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Input Format

Your **questions.docx** file should adhere to the following format:

1. **Question Format:**
   1. Each question begins with a number (e.g., 1. , 2. ) followed by the question text ending with a ‚Äò?‚Äô or ‚Äò:‚Äô.
2. **Answer Options:**
   1. Each answer option starts with a capital letter (e.g., A. , B. , C. , etc.), followed by the answer text and ending with ;[\*].
   2. The correct answer is marked with an extra equals sign at the end (e.g., ;[\*] =).

## Example:

```vbnet
1. What is the capital of France?
A. Berlin;[*]
B. Madrid;[*]
C. Paris;[*] =
D. Rome;[*]
```

## Usage

1. Place your `questions.docx` file inside a folder.

2. Run the script using the command line with the following parameters:
   1. **directory**: The path to your folder containing questions.docx.
   1. **count**: The number of questions to select randomly.
   1. **range** (optional): The range of question numbers to select from (e.g., range=10,20).

For example, to select 5 random questions from a given folder:

```bash
npm run dev directory="path/to/your/folder" count=5
```

For example, to select 5 random questions from question numbers 10 to 20:

```bash
npm run dev directory="path/to/your/folder" count=5 range=10,20
```

The script will generate a file named randoms.docx in the same folder.

## Output

The generated **randoms.docx** file contains:

- **Randomized Questions:**
  Each question is displayed with its randomized answer options (labeled A, B, C, ‚Ä¶) without any indication of which option is correct.
- **Answer Summary:**
  At the end of the document, a summary is appended in white text showing the correct answer for each question in the following format:

```bash
answers:[
 {Q: 1; A: A},
 {Q: 2; A: B},
]
```

## Dependencies

- **mammoth**: Extracts raw text from .docx files.
- **docx**: Generates .docx documents with custom styling.
- **fs** and **path**: Node.js modules for file system and path handling.
